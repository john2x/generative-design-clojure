# Generative Design in Clojure

My attempt to learn Clojure by going through the code of
[Generative Design][gd] and porting them into Clojure with [Quil][quil].

## Usage

    $ lein run `part` `chapter`
	# e.g.
	# to run the sketch in generative_design_clojure/principles/P_1_0_01
	$ lein run principles P_1_0_01

See [Quil's][quil] page for more info.

#### P.1 Colour
