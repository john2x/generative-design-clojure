# Generative Design in Clojure

My attempt to learn [Clojure][] (and [Processing][]!) by going through
the code of [Generative Design][gd] and porting them to Clojure with
[Quil][quil].

I'll try to keep it as similar to the original as possible, for easy
reference (and progress :P). So if you're looking for mind-blowing
Clojure code, you might want to look somewhere else. 

When I've finished porting all of them, or when I'm confident enough,
I'll probably go through each one again and write more elegant versions
of each. (But that will be a *long* ways off.)

## Usage

    $ lein run `part` `chapter`
	# e.g.
	# to run the sketch in generative_design_clojure/principles/P_1_0_01
	$ lein run principles P_1_0_01

See [Quil's][quil] page for more info.
